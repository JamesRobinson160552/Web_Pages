Final Project Proposal
    Using MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node, create an API which can create, 
    retrieve, update, and delete entries in a plant registry database.
    
    The API will access collections to track all the plants in a garden and
    manage information like species, number, age, expected bloom date, and
    water and fertilizer requirements.
